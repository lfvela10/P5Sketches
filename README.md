# P5Sketches
Art sketches made with the p5.js library


************************** Issue(s) ********************************

The issue I was having was that the WEBGL portion of the createCanvas function was making my non-3D images act funky.
I do not have a description of what funky is, it just isn't what i intended to do when the sketches were built seperately.

I left out the WEBGL because 2/3 work without it. The third works fine, just needs WEBGL to run.

Other than that, I think its ok.
